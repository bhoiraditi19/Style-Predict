## ⭐ Features

- 📂 **Preloaded Dataset Analysis**  
  App uses a built-in historical transaction dataset — no upload required.

- 📊 **Insights Page for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**  
  A dedicated “Insights” page shows visualizations such as category-wise sales, payment distributions, and trends — all rendered from backend-generated images.

- 🤖 **XGBoost Model-Based Prediction**  
  Sales forecasting is powered by a pre-trained XGBoost model built using realistic, real-world purchase behavior.

- 🎯 **Filter-Based Custom Predictions**  
  Users can dynamically adjust inputs like:
  - Product category  
  - Age group  
  - Gender  
  - Location  
  - Payment method  
  - Future time horizon (in months)

- 📈 **Forecast Future Sales**  
  App predicts total future sales (1 to 12 months ahead) based on filtered criteria and displays results with clear visual styling.

- 🌐 **Multiple Web Pages**  
  Fully structured frontend with the following routes/pages:
  - Home  
  - Prediction  
  - Insights (EDA)
  - How It Works
  - About Us  
  - Contact Us  
  - Privacy Policy  

- 📱 **Responsive UI**  
  The app is mobile-friendly on most pages (except Insights, currently desktop-optimized).
